## Generate your own music genre

🎤 🎧 🎼 🎹 🥁 🎷 🎺 🎸 🎻 💽 💿 🔊 👩‍🎤 👨🏻‍🎤

This is a small web app built using Express that generates fake musical genres from a list of candidate words.

It uses a custom [screenshot-service](https://github.com/alextea/screenshot-service) to create screenshots of the genres and uploads them to an S3 bucket for use as social sharing images.

## Installing 💾
To run the app locally, clone the repo and then run `npm install`

`npm run deploy` will build the CSS files and copy the static assets.

Then you can run `npm run dev-start` to run the app using nodemon and watch the SCSS files for changes.

### Configuration ⚙️
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. Required variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string
- `LASTFM_API_KEY` — [Last.fm API key](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) for the `/listen` track lookup

### Screenshots 🖼
Screenshots are generated by a custom [screenshot-service](https://github.com/alextea/screenshot-service) and stored in an S3 bucket. Configure the relevant S3 and screenshot service variables in `.env`.

### Last.fm track lookup 🎵
The `/listen/:slug` route fetches tracks from Last.fm for each genre using [music-genre-lastfm-utils](https://github.com/alextea/music-genre-lastfm-utils). It tries the full genre name as a tag first, then falls back to a sliding-window n-gram search so that multi-word tags like "hip hop" are found before individual words.

## List of words 📜
The list of words is stored in `/data/words.json` and is separated in adjectives and nouns.

The genres are generated from the list of words combining 1-3 adjectives with 1-3 nouns at random.
